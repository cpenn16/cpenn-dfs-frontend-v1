## Race Preview

The Bristol night race concludes our first round of the playofffs in the 2025 season and for NASCAR DFS players, this race is all about **nailing your dominators** as 500 laps around this half mile concrete bowl is going to provide drivers ample opportunity to rack up dominator points on Saturday.  

- Bristol at times can get chaotic and Goodyear is trying to bring a tire with more wear this weekend.  
- We have seen this track get progressively worse in recent memory and long runs aren’t out of the question.  
- In the event of this, **track position will be huge** and drivers that start in the back are at major risk of losing a lap early on.  

We will want to:  
- Target **at least two dominators** per lineup.  
- Depending on price, three at times is also sufficient — even if it takes playing multiple punts.  
- Rely more on **track history** than most places: the drivers that are good here tend to run well every visit.

## Practice Notes

- **Ryan Blaney** → Best car on paper. In Group B he posted the best overall consecutive lap runs deep in the run and was also the quickest in his group (all playoff drivers).  
- **Bubba Wallace** → Looked strong, finishing 2nd to Blaney in Group B and top 10 overall.  
- **Spire Motorsports** → Once again lit up the early practice board (Group A), but be careful buying into them having race-winning speed.

## Bets

- **Early in the week:** None  
- **Post P&Q:** None  

---

## Cash Core

**Kyle Larson — $11,500 (Start: 5th)**  
- Has had multiple “parades” in his honor here at Bristol in recent years.  
- Spring race: led **400+ laps** en route to his second straight victory.  
- Fall race last year: led **464 laps** — elite history at Bristol.  
- Didn’t light up practice, but the No. 5 team has been too good here not to be recognized as the **top dominator**.  

---

**Ryan Blaney — $10,700 (Start: 2nd)**  
- On paper, Blaney looks like the **car to beat** Saturday night.  
- Topped Group B overall in practice and had the fastest long-run speed.  
- Starting on the front row keeps him in an excellent position to establish himself up front.  
- Doesn’t have Larson/Hamlin’s pedigree here, but has had strong runs ruined by DNFs or issues.  

---

**Corey Heim — $5,900 (Start: 38th)**  
- Pure salary relief to jam dominators.  
- Starting dead last makes him an appealing punt with place-diff upside.  
- Don’t expect Truck Series dominance, but his practice times were mid-pack in his group.  

---

## GPP Core

**Bubba Wallace — $9,000 (Start: 8th)**  
- Feels like a weekly write-up at this point.  
- Typically underpriced and shows elite practice speed that translates to race speed.  
- Awkward qualifying keeps ownership low.  
- Viewed as a **lower-tier dominator** with top-10 finish potential.  

---

**Ty Gibbs — $8,700 (Start: 4th)**  
- Has been very strong at Bristol since joining Cup.  
- Even dominated this race in recent memory.  
- Solid practice times in his group.  
- Starting 4th = dominator potential, but beware of the **low floor**.  

---

**RFK Racing (Keselowski / Buescher / Preece)**  
- All in the **7k range**, starting near each other mid-pack.  
- Not deep enough for chalk, but safe enough to stay on the lead lap without early yellows.  
- Solid track records at Bristol in the Next Gen car.  
- **Buescher even won here before.**  
- All three carry **borderline top-10 upside**.
