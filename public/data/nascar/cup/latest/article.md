## Race Preview

The Bristol night race concludes the first round of the playoffs in the 2025 season and for NASCAR DFS players, this race is all about **nailing your dominators** as 500 laps around this half mile concrete bowl is going to provide drivers ample opportunity to rack up dominator points on Saturday.  

Bristol at times can get chaotic and Goodyear is trying to bring a tire with more wear this weekend but we have seen this track get progressively worse in recent memory and long runs arenâ€™t out of the question. In the event of this, **track position will be huge** and drivers that start in the back are at major risk of losing a lap early on.  

We will want to target at least **two dominators** per lineup and depending on price, three at times is also sufficient even if it takes playing multiple punts. Bristol is also a very unique track and because of this, I tend to rely more on **track history** here than most as the drivers that happen to be good here tend to just run well each visit.

## Practice Notes

- **Ryan Blaney** â†’ Best car on paper, despite being in group B he posted the best overall consecutive lap runs deep in the run and was also the quickest in his group (which was all playoff drivers).  
- **Bubba Wallace** â†’ Looked strong, 2nd to Blaney in Group B and top 10 overall.  
- **Spire Motorsports** â†’ Once again the Saturday (in this case Friday) superstars lit up the practice board early in Group A but I would be careful buying into them having race winning speed.

## ðŸ’° Cash Core

> ### Kyle Larson $11,500 (5th)  
> - If you are into parades Kyle Larson has had quite a few in his honor here at Bristol in recent yearsâ€¦ Even as recent as this spring when he lead over 400 laps on his way to his second straight victory at the track.  
> - In the fall race last year at this time, he led ever more laps (464) and has overall been elite here in his career.  
> - He didnâ€™t completely light up practice but the no.5 team has been too good here to not be recognized as the top dominator and he has the track position to set himself up for dominator points throughout the night.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Ryan Blaney $10,700 (2nd)  
> - On paper it looks like Blaney has the car to beat on Saturday night as he topped group B overall in practice and was the fastest car in the long run overall.  
> - Track position will be king tonight and starting on the front row keeps Blaney in an excellent position to establish himself up front at some point.  
> - While he doesnâ€™t have the pedigree of Kyle Larson or Denny Hamlin at Bristolâ€¦ Heâ€™s had many good runs here ruined by DNFâ€™s or issues out of his control.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Corey Heim $5,900 (38th)  
> - Thereâ€™s really nothing else to say here besidesâ€¦ If we are trying to jam dominators we need a cheap plays.  
> - And itâ€™s harder to find a more appealing one than Heim sub 6k starting in the very back (Finchum doesnâ€™t count).  
> - Donâ€™t expect Truck series level speed but in his practice group his times were in the top half.

## ðŸŽ¯ GPP Core

> ### Bubba Wallace $9,000 (8th)  
> - It almost feels like a bit at this point but I seriously just end up writing up Bubba Wallace in this section every single week.  
> - But itâ€™s for a good cause! As he is typically underpriced weekly and shows elite speed in practice that translates to race speed.  
> - The great thing about it is that he keeps getting these awkward qualifying positions which lead to lower ownership despite once again him being one of the fastest cars in his practice group.  
> - Iâ€™m viewing him as a lower tier dominator with the potential to scrape fast laps to a top 10 finish.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Ty Gibbs $8,700 (4th)  
> - I genuinely despise writing up Ty Gibbs as I never seem to get him right so thatâ€™s a fair warning to you allâ€¦ But this is a similar spot to Bubba.  
> - Gibbs has also been very strong at Bristol since coming up to the Cup Series and even dominated in this race in recent memory.  
> - His practice times were very solid in his group and this starting position opens the door to the potential dominator points we are so desperately chasing on this slate.  
> - Just be aware of the low floor he has.  
> 
> ---
> 
> ### RFK Racing (Brad Keselowski / Chris Buescher / Ryan Preece)  
> - Is this cheating? It kind of feels like it but they all start next to each other and they are all 7k so it only feels right to lump them as one.  
> - I love the spot they fell in for qualifying as itâ€™s not deep enough to warrant extreme chalk and itâ€™s close enough to where they should be able to survive competing to stay on the lead lap in the event of no early yellows.  
> - Each driver has a solid track record at Bristol in the next-gen car and Buescher even won here before as well.  
> - I think all three have borderline top 10 upside and I like the track position advantage they have on the other place differential plays.
