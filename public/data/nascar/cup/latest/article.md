## Race Preview

The Bristol night race concludes the first round of the 2025 playoffs, and for NASCAR DFS players this race is all about **nailing your dominators**.  
500 laps around this half-mile concrete bowl offers plenty of dominator points.  

⚠️ **Track Chaos Alert:** Goodyear is bringing a tire aimed at more wear this weekend, but Bristol has gotten progressively worse in recent memory. Long green-flag runs are possible, and **track position will be huge** — backmarkers risk going a lap down early.  

✅ **DFS Strategy:**  
- Target **at least two dominators** per lineup.  
- Three dominators can work depending on pricing, even if it means punting.  
- Rely on **track history** more than usual: Bristol is one of those places where good drivers stay good.

## Practice Notes

- **Ryan Blaney** → Best car on paper. In Group B, he posted the best long-run pace and was quickest in his group (all playoff drivers).  
- **Bubba Wallace** → Looked strong, 2nd to Blaney in Group B and top 10 overall.  
- **Spire Motorsports** → Lit up early practice (Group A), but beware — not true race-winning speed.

## Bets

- **Early in the Week:** None  
- **Post P&Q:** None  

---

## Cash Core

### Kyle Larson — $11,500 (Start: 5th)
- Bristol’s king lately: led **400+ laps** in the spring and **464 laps** in last year’s fall race.  
- Didn’t dominate practice, but history + track position makes him the **top dominator**.  

---

### Ryan Blaney — $10,700 (Start: 2nd)
- Looked like the **car to beat** in practice, topping Group B and long-run speed.  
- Track position on the front row = early dominator opportunity.  
- Doesn’t have Larson/Hamlin pedigree here, but his bad luck has masked solid runs.  

---

### Corey Heim — $5,900 (Start: 38th)
- Pure punt play to jam in dominators.  
- Starting dead last gives him place-diff upside.  
- Don’t expect Truck Series dominance, but times in practice were mid-pack.  

---

## GPP Core

### Bubba Wallace — $9,000 (Start: 8th)
- Weekly underpriced gem.  
- Consistently fast in practice → race speed translates.  
- Awkward qualifying keeps ownership low.  
- Viewed as a **lower-tier dominator** with top-10 finish potential.  

---

### Ty Gibbs — $8,700 (Start: 4th)
- Strong at Bristol since joining Cup.  
- Solid practice times + good track history.  
- Starting 4th = dominator potential but beware of **low floor**.  

---

### RFK Racing Trio — (Keselowski • Buescher • Preece)
- All in the **7k range**, starting together mid-pack.  
- Not deep enough for chalk, but safe enough to survive early chaos.  
- Solid Bristol records; Buescher even won here.  
- All three carry **borderline top-10 upside**.
